/* The DelayedBroadcaster class attempts to delay sending
 * UDP packets until exactly RF transmission.
 *
 * This class is useful when the consumer of these UDP
 * packets is not designed to receive the contents ahead
 * of GPS time/RF transmission.
 *
 * This class manages a separate thread in which the
 * DelayedBroadcastWorker runs. It pushes data to the
 * thread using QT's thread-safe signals/slots.
 *
 * The DelayedBroadcastWorker waits until the given
 * deadline before sending the packet. There is a grace
 * period where the packet may be sent ahead of the deadline.
 *
 * In practice, the usual-case of the DelayedBroadcaster
 * is very good and can send packets within microseconds
 * of matching RF. However, hiccups on the order of a few
 * milliseconds may occur and this class cannot guarantee
 * the broadcast time of any packet.
 *
 * This class will be at the mercy of the operating system
 * scheduler.
